# DOT configuration

## How the tool connects to the database

There is just 1 config file that control how the tool connects to the database; follow the link to see an [example file](dot/config/example/dot_config.yml).

This file contains connection parameters for the DOT database and also for any of the project databases (e.g. `Muso`)
for which you want to run the DOT tests. See more details in the paragraph below on how to adapt this and other config files to your needs.

Additionally to the database connections handled in `dot_config.yml`, the different objects generated by the DOT
can be stored in different schemas. Read below about the file `dbt_project.yml` to learn how to define these output schemas.

## Running the tool per project

The DOT can be run per project, where configuration and output files for each project are found in the following directories:
1. mandatory configuration
```bash
|____config
| |____dot_config.yml
```
2. optional per project configuration
```bash
|____config
| |____<project_name>
| | |____dbt
| | | |____profiles.yml
| | | |____dbt_project.yml
| | |____ge
| | | |____great_expectations.yml
| | | |____config_variables.yml
| | | |____batch_config.json
```
3. generated files per project
```bash
|____generated_files
| |____<project_name>
| | |____all_tests_summary.xlsx
| | |____ge_clean_results.csv
| | |____dbt_test_coverage_report.txt
| | |____all_tests_rows.xlsx
```

### Configuration per project

All config files are grouped under the [config dir](dot/config). Example config files for all projects are in the [example's folder](dot/config/example);
if any project needs custom configuration, please follow the guidelines below for either changing connections to 
ddbb or other configuration.

#### For the database connection

A single file controls connections the DOT and any project for which you want to run DOT tests:
- copy the default [dot_config](dot/config/example/dot_config.yml) into the top config folder (i.e. as `dot/config/dot_config.yml`)
- note that the copied file will be ignored for version control
- change the necessary parameters for the dot_db connection, e.g. `host`, `dbname`
- add connection parameters for each of the projects you would like to run, with the same structure 
as the `Muso_db` entry for the [dot_config example](dot/config/example/dot_config.yml), i.e.
```
<project_name>_db:
  type: connection type e.g. postgres
  host: host
  user: username
  pass: password
  port: port number e.g 5432
  dbname: database name
  schema: schema name, e.g. public
  threads: nubmer of threads for DBT, e.g. 4
```
- note that the DOT and the project connections should be at least in different schemas, but also they can be either
in different databases of the same host, or in different servers

#### Other project-dependent configurations

You can overwrite the config files for DBT and Great Expectations to modify their behaviour.
In general these customizations will not be needed, but only in some scenarios with particular requirements;
these require a deeper knowledge of the DOT and of either DBT and/or Great Expectations.

As a 1st step, do create a subdirectory under the [config dir](dot/config) with the project name (i.e. `dot/config/<project_name>`),
then create folders `dbt` and `ge`, and put in these the files that you want to customise.

##### dbt_project.yml (DBT)

This file goes into the [dbt main folder](dot/dbt). If you don't need to customise it, the DOT uses this [example file](dot/config/example/project_name/dbt/dbt_project.yml),
after a few project-dependent adjustments:
- `model-paths` is set to a subdirectory for the project, i.e. `["models_<project_name>"]`
- `test-paths` is also set to a subdirectory for the project, i.d. `["tests_<project_name>"]`

and the modified version is copied by the DOT into the destination [dbt main folder](dot/dbt).

The tool also copies the content of the [models folder](dot/dbt/models/core) into the model path for the project, `dot/dbt/models/<project_name>/core`,
and creates the custom SQL tests at `dot/dbt/tests/<project_name>`.

If you wanted to modify the final `dbt_project.yml` , you would:
- copy the default [dbt_project](dot/config/example/project_name/dbt/dbt_project.yml) into the project folder (i.e. as `dot/config/<project_name>/dbt/dbt_project.yml`)
- modify `model-paths` into `["models_<project_name>"]`, as the tool does
- modify `test-paths` into `["tests_<project_name>"]`, as the tool does
- add your customizations

An example of a common personalization would be for changing the schema in which the objects generated by the dot are written.
See the paragraph just below.

##### Writing the output objects of the DOT to different schemas

The DOT generates 2 kind of database objects:
- entities of the models that are being tested, e.g. assessments, follow ups, patients
- results of the failing tests

If nothing is done, these objects would be created in the same schema as the original data for the project (thus polluting the db).

The following lines added to `dbt_project.yml` will modify where those objects are stored:
```
models:
  dbt_model_1:
    core:
      +schema: <schema_suffix>
    test:
      +schema: <schema_suffix>
```
Which will be added as a suffix. I.e. if the project data is stored in a certain schema, the output objects will go to 
`<project_schema>_<schema_suffix>` (e.g. to `public_tests` if the project schema is `public` and the suffix is set to
`tests` in the lines above).

Note that this mechanism uses a DBT feature, and that the same applies to the GE tests.

Finally, although this is not really recommended, you can send the 2 different types of outputs to 2 schemas:
- `core` in the lines above corresponds to the models
- `test` corresponds to the failing test results

##### profiles.yml (DBT)

This DBT configuration file goes into `~/.dbt/profiles.yml`. If you don't need to customise it, the [example file](dot/config/example/project_name/dbt/profiles.yml)
is modified by the tool, using the connection parameters for the DOTdb in the [dot_config](dot/config/example/dot_config.yml) file.
The modified [example file](dot/config/example/project_name/dbt/profiles.yml) is then copied into `~/.dbt/profiles.yml`,
although note that if a version of the file currently exists in `~/.dbt/profiles.yml` (which of course will not happen when running from docker),
then the file is not overwritten by the tool, and further modifications should be done manually. 

Apparently there is no good reason to customise this [profiles file](dot/config/example/project_name/dbt/profiles.yml),
other than adapting the connection parameters as the tool already does, but anyway if you put a modified copy of the file at the project folders,
i.e. in `dot/config/<project_name>/dbt/profiles.yml` this file with no modifications will be put into `~/.dbt/profiles.yml` 
-and again the file will not be overwritten if a previous version already exists.

##### great_expectations.yml (GE)

This file goes into the [great expectations main folder](dot/great_expectations). If you don't need to customise it, 
the [example file](dot/config/example/project_name/ge/great_expectations.yml) is used, after a few project-dependent 
adjustments done by the tool:
- `base_directory` of the expectations store is set to a subdirectory for the project: `["expectations/<project_name>"]`
- `base_directory` of the validations store is also set to a subdirectory for the project: `["uncommitted/validations/<project_name>"]`

and the modified version is copied by the tool into the destination [great expectations main folder](dot/great_expectations).

You may want to modify the final `great_expectations.yml` for adjusting the behaviour of Great Expectations tests.
These would be the steps:
- copy the default [ge yaml](dot/config/example/project_name/ge/great_expectations.yml) into the project folder 
(e.g. as `dot/config/Muso/ge/great_expectations.yml`)
- modify `base_directory` of the expectations store to a subdirectory for the project, `["expectations/<project_name>"]`, as the tool does
- modify `base_directory` of the validations store to a subdirectory for the project, `["uncommitted/validations/<project_name>"]`, as the tool does
- add your required adjustments

##### batch_config.json (GE)

This file goes into the [great expectations main folder](dot/great_expectations). If you don't need to customise it, 
the [example file](dot/config/example/project_name/ge/batch_config.json) is used as is and copied into the destination [great expectations main folder](dot/great_expectations).

There are no obvious reasons why you may want to customize this file, but if you want to do so, 1st copy the [batch config json](dot/config/example/project_name/ge/batch_config.json)
into the project folder, i.e. as `dot/config/<project_name>/ge/batch_config.json` and then do the necessary adaptations.

##### config_variables.yml (GE)

This GE configuration file goes into `dot/great_expectations/uncommitted/config_variables.yml`
(note that this destination is actually path controlled by the [ge yaml](dot/config/example/project_name/ge/great_expectations.yml)).
If you don't need to customise it, the [example file](dot/config/example/project_name/ge/config_variables.yml)
is modified by the tool, using the connection parameters for the DOT db in the [dot_config](dot/config/example/dot_config.yml) file.
The modified [example file](dot/config/example/project_name/ge/config_variables.yml) is then copied by the tool into `dot/great_expectations/uncommitted/config_variables.yml`.

Apparently there is no good reason to customise this [config_variables file](dot/config/example/project_name/ge/great_expectations.yml),
other than adapting the connection parameters as the tool already does, but anyway if you put an adapted copy of the file at the project folders,
i.e. in `dot/config/<project_name>/ge/great_expectations.yml` this file with no modifications will be put into `dot/great_expectations/uncommitted/config_variables.yml`.
